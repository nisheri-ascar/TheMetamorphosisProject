title: Dear Nobody | Hundred Reasons On Not
---

Dear Nobody.

I'm certain you will never ever read this, and thats fine. Metaphorically this was meant as a letter to myself, but it tells much
more reason on why, why things didn't work out, why it happened. Its a selfish message.

Isn't all my letter all selfish?

This journal is a collective message, meaning a bunch of entries in undisciplined timing manner is written on this one post. 
I'm sure the letters I wrote never made sense in just one reading, so hopefully this creates much more better sense.
