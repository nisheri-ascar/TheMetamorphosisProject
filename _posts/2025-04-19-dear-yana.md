title: Dear Yana | Hundred Reasons On Not
---

Dear Yana.

I'm certain you will never ever read this, and thats fine. Metaphorically this was meant as a letter to myself, but it tells much
more reason on why, why things didn't work out, why it happened. Its a selfish message.

Isn't all my letter all selfish?
