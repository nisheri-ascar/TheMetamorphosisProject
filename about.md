"What makes a sky blue?"

A constant question that keeps unraveling over and over again in my childhood mind.
As I got older, I gained knowledge on why—the scientific explanation, of course. The ozone layer and atmospheric particles scatter sunlight, limiting the wavelengths that reach our eyes, allowing blue to dominate the sky. It made sense. But the more I opened my eyes, the more I realized how naive I was in understanding this world.

"Why is the sky blue?" Why do we find beauty in it? Who decided that blue should be the color of the sky? Why does it evoke a sense of calmness, vastness, and mystery? The question stretches beyond the confines of science, spilling into the realms of philosophy, perception, and even fate. The more I ask, the more I feel the question slipping further and further away, like the endless horizon itself.

And yet, beneath all these scattered thoughts, one fundamental question remains—one that gives rise to all others:

"Why is everything?"

Perhaps the sky is not just blue. Perhaps it is a reflection of the questions we dare to ask, the mysteries we long to unravel, and the infinite unknown that lingers just beyond our reach.
